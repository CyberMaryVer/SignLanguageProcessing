Neural Sign Language Synthesis: Words Are Our Glosses

Our pipeline progress as follows:
	1) Packing relevant (see variable idxsPose and idxsHand) keypoints stored as json files into a single h5 file.
	2) Using a filter to interpolate missing keypoints. This filter uses the described backpropagation-based 2D->3D skeleton transformation.
	3) Transforming absolute positions into vectors.
	4) Normalizing standard deviance.
	5) Computing an average pose.
	6) Training a model.
