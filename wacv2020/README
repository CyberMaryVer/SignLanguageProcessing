Neural Sign Language Synthesis: Words Are Our Glosses

Scripts required the TensorFlow toolbox. The verified TensorFlow version is 1.15.0.

This archive includes a small toy database (demo). JSON files are packed into a zip file.

Our pipeline progress as follows:
	1) Packing relevant (see variable idxsPose and idxsHand) keypoints stored as JSON files into a single H5 file. (see pipeline_demo_01_json2h5.py)
	2) Using a filter to interpolate missing keypoints. This filter uses the described backpropagation-based 2D->3D skeleton transformation. (see pipeline_demo_02_filter.py)
	3) Transforming absolute positions into vectors. (see pipeline_demo_03_deltas.py)
	4) Normalizing standard deviance. (see pipeline_demo_04_norm.py)
	5) Computing an average pose. (see pipeline_demo_05_mu.py)
	6) Training a model. (pipeline_demo_06-train-model_FF_05.py)

The described gradient-based pose reconstruction is used in the second step. The algorithm is implemented in the file pose3D.py. The described initialization is the function initialization in the file pose2Dto3D.py. Algorithms use skeletal structure defined in the script skeletalModel.py.
